Are you tired of endless notes on papers, unorganized web and mobile apps for daily tracking. Do you find tiring to log your activities every day ? Are you as a doctor tired of managing your patient daily info ?

`Happy Habits` is a mobile android app, that is designed both for patients and for users. It is a suitable application for daily tracking activity and also bridges the gap between patient and doctor.

### `Happy Habits` is divided into 2 sections:
- üì± [Mobile-App](../Mobile-App/): Find the frontend and the [UI-UX](#ui-ux) of our app. It has been implemented to be user friendly for the patients and the doctors.
- üñ•Ô∏è [API-Server](../API-Server/): This is the core of our app. Here is the implementation of the backend. Every here is connected to serve all users. It manages the CRUD operations to the database and functions as a hub for the chat communication.

## üîëWho can use `Happy Habits` ?
- ü§í Patients: First and foremost anybody can use the application. But it is especially designed for users who want to:
  * üîí Authenticate, sign up and log in.
  * üóíÔ∏è Track their daily activities such as food and medication consumption and others (toilet, workout, sleep, symptoms and mood).
  * üìä Check statistics for some activities.
  * üí¨ Chat and send to doctors their log record.
- ü©∫ Doctors: Doctors can also make good use of our app, in order to connect, communicate and receive the records of their patients via email.

To all of the above, patients and doctors can connect using the QR code feature, shown in the [UI-UX](#ui-ux) section.

> ‚ùó However, the qr code feature can only connect a patient and a doctor, but not two users who belong to the same group
## üñºÔ∏èArchitecture

  * ### Top Level Architecture
    Here is a diagram which showcases the main components communicate and share information between them.

  * ### Frontend Level Architecture
    As the diagram below shows, frontend design follow the [M(odel)-V(iew)-V(iew)M(odel)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93viewmodel) architecture, and also some characteristics of the [Clean](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/a-quick-introduction-to-clean-architecture-990c014448d2/) architecture.

  * ### Backend Level Architecture
    On the other hand, backend design is constructed on the simple Controller-Service-Repository pattern, following the principles of the REST Api architecture.

  * Coompose, for the UI design
  * Hilt-Dagger, for the Dependency Injection
On the Api, we used:
  * AspNetCore, for the development of the Api
